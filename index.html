                        If a function accepts another function as an argument it is wrapped in parentheses. The letters a, b, c, d are used to signify that the argument can be of any type.
                        Here we have a simple function, length, that accepts a word, of type String, and returns the count of characters in the
                        string, which is a Number. The comment above the function is a signature line. It starts with the name of the function,
                        then the separator "::" and then the actual description of the functions.</div>
